### ✨ Creative Writing Instructions:

1. **Hook from Line One:** Start the book with a cinematic, dopamine-inducing hook that instantly grabs attention and builds tension, curiosity, or emotional pull.
2. **Deeply Human Emotions:** Infuse every chapter with human emotion — joy, fear, shame, love, lust, ambition, heartbreak — relevant to the genre and character arcs. Use visceral reactions and emotionally intelligent narration.
3. **Chapter Structuring:**
   - Each chapter must be complete: with a setup, escalation, conflict/resolution or epiphany.
   - Use a momentum curve that keeps readers turning pages, craving more.
4. **Voice Consistency:** Stay consistent with chosen tone and style (e.g., poetic, sarcastic, dark, whimsical, minimalist, edgy).
5. **Neuro-Engagement Tactics:**
   - Use epiphanies, open loops, and cliffhangers.
   - Embed subtle psychological cues that trigger dopamine, oxytocin, and anticipation.
   - Evoke nostalgia, mystery, empowerment, or forbidden desire when appropriate.
6. **Keep It Legendary Yet Simple:**
   - Break down complex themes or ideas in ways even a 12-year-old could understand, without dumbing it down.
   - Use analogies, metaphors, and real-world comparisons that resonate.
7. **Dialogue Mastery:** Make every line of dialogue reveal character, intention, or emotional depth. Use subtext where possible.
8. **Originality & Integrity:**
   - 100% unique content, no plagiarism, clichés, or AI-sounding filler.
   - If using known tropes, subvert them creatively.
9. **Pacing & Flow:**
   - Keep chapters within the word limit.
   - Balance narrative with introspection, action with reflection.
10. **Formatting & Polish:**
    - Use clean title case for headings.
    - Maintain paragraph spacing, smart punctuation, and consistent visual flow.
    - Include a table of contents at the beginning.
11. **Final Impression:** Close the book with a powerful ending — emotional, unresolved, poetic, philosophical, or plot-twisting — based on genre and audience needs. Leave the reader changed, moved, and craving your next work.

** Do not use "—", instead use the relevant punctuation marks.
